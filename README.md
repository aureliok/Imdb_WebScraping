# Imdb_WebScraping
WebScraping Movies from IMDB.com (Work in progress)

Little project to study a little bit of WebScraping and perhaps a little bit of NLP.
Will try to extract information of various movies from IMDB.com and then try to analyse reviews and ratings.

## Python Scripts
1. web_scrap_imdb.py
   * This script takes as a argument a year, and returns a .csv file with all the movies released on that year. It can also take multiple years as an argument.
   
2. imdb_tidy.py
   * This script will be used to tidy the data extracted with web_scrap_imdb.py.
   * Input arguments are years of the csv files generated by the previous script.
